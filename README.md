# Auctions: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning 

Claire Wang, Sarah Su, Tara Razaei, Rishika Bansal, Michelle Chang 

Will simulated agents in a “bidding war” will converge to an equilibria using reinforcement learning over multiple auction rounds. We will test different initial value distributions and different learning algorithms/rates to test how each agent’s strategy profile shifts and whether the agents reach an equilibrium.
